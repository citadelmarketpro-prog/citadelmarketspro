              Trading in financial instruments carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable
              for all investors. The high degree of leverage that is often obtainable in trading can
              work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to trade, you should carefully
              consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite.

              not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks
              associated with trading and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you
              have any doubts.
