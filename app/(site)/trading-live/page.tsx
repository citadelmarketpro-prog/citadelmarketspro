                A trading platform is a software system, typically offered through a brokerage, that
                lets you trade online, on your own — accessing stock markets, placing trades, monitoring
                positions, and managing your account.

                Trading platforms can offer a number of powerful features. Broadly speaking, these
                include real-time stock quotes, live business and financial news feeds, instant access
                to streaming and historical stock market data, technical analysis tools, investment

                There are two main types of trading platforms: commercial platforms and proprietary
                platforms. Commercial platforms are designed for active traders and retail investors.
                They are characterised by ease of use and helpful features such as real-time stock
                quotes, market news feeds, live interactive charts, educational content, and research
                tools tailored for equity markets.

                  The key factors necessary to succeed in active stock trading are fast, reliable
                  execution of trades and the lowest possible trading commissions. A trader can have a
                  majority of winning stock trades, yet still lose money at the end of the day if their
                  commissions outweigh their profits. Since active traders are continually buying and
                  selling equities, they may rack up substantial costs in the form of trading commissions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Similarly, optimal execution of orders is essential. Getting in and out of the stock
                  market and taking small profits continually throughout the day requires efficient order
                  execution. During fast-moving market conditions — such as at the market open or just
                  after an important earnings release or economic announcement — it is especially
                  important to be working with a broker that can provide reliable, low-latency order
                  execution on equity positions.
